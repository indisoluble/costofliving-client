FIRST iOS APP: COST OF LIVING
=============================

This is the first iOS application I develop. It's a client for a server which main purpose is to maintain a central database with prices for different products all around the world (or, at least, where there're iPhone users).

So far, this sounds boring, doesn't it? Well, this client is not intended to be a simple utility to upload data but like an agent for a social network following countries or cities, instead of people. Now, this sounds better and more interesting.

Server side is going to be developed by myself in other project.
